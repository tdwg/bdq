# üì£ Welcome to the Public Review of the Biodiversity Data Quality (BDQ) Standard

Thank you for participating in the review of the proposed **Biodiversity Data Quality (BDQ) Core** standard.  
This folder includes documents that are intended to form part of the standard, as well as supporting resources to use, develop and maintain it.

## üß≠ How to Approach the Review

The BDQ Core standard is complex. There are requirements about which documents must exist and even what they should look like. Because of this the body of documentation can be complex to navigate. It will help to think of the standard as having two major, interconnected parts:

- **BDQ Core Tests and Assertions:**  
  Practical Tests and associated guidance for assessing biodiversity data quality.
- **Fitness for Use Framework:**  
  The theoretical foundation that defines key concepts of data quality "Fitness for Use".

## üöÄ Choose Your Review Path

### A. Introduction
First, read [**Biodiversity Data Quality Core**](./index.md). This is the introduction and landing page for the standard (see section '2.2.1 Standards landing page' in the [TDWG Standards Documentation Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/sds/documentation-specification.md)). Then, you can approach the remainder of the review either from the practical perspective (the Tests) or from the theoretical one (the Framework). 

### B. Documents emphasizing BDQ in Practice (the Tests)
Within the practical perspective there are two basic audiences, Users and Implementers, with fundamental interests in common. For either of these audiences, the [**BDQ Core Quick Reference Guide**](docs/terms/bdqcore/index.md) is good continuation following the introductory [Biodiversity Data Quality Core](./index.md). The Quick Reference Guide is an informative go-to reference with only the essential information about the BDQ Core Tests. Also of common interest to Users and Implementers is the in-depth introduction and required landing page for the Tests vocabulary - [**BDQ Core Tests and Assertions**](docs/bdqcore/index.md). After all of this orientational material, there are guides specifically targeting Users and Implementers:

#### 1. Users
- [**BDQ Core User's Guide**](docs/guide/users/index.md)

#### 2. Implementers
- [**BDQ Core Implementer's Guide**](docs/guide/implementers/index.md)
- [**BDQ Core: Identifying Synthetic and Modified Data**](docs/synthetic/index.md)

### C. Documents emphasizing **BDQ in Theory (the Framework)**:
The theoretical perspective is formally based on the [Biodiversity Data Quality Fitness for Use Framework](vocabulary/bdqffdq.owl) OWL ontology. The following documents explain the ontology and how it is extended for use with the BDQ Tests and Assertions (the Tests):
- [**Fitness for Use Framework Ontology**](docs/bdqffdq/index.md)
- [**Fitness for Use Framework Vocabulary Extension**](docs/extension/bdqffdq/index.md)
- [**Fitness for Use Framework Ontology Guide**](docs/guide/bdqffdq/index.md)

### D. Vocabularies
The Tests and the Framework are linked with each other via **foundational vocabularies** and **controlled vocabularies of values**. The terms in these vocabularies are formally defined in the **List of terms** documents, one for each vocabulary defined by the BDQ Core standard. We recommend reviewing these vocabularies carefully as well:
- [**BDQ Core Tests and Assertions List of Terms (bdqcore:)**](docs/list/bdqcore/index.md)
- [**BDQ Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms (bdq:)**](docs/list/bdq/index.md)
- [**Data Quality Criterion Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms (bdqcrit:)**](docs/list/bdqcrit/index.md)
- [**Data Quality Dimension Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms (bdqdim:)**](docs/list/bdqdim/index.md)
- [**Data Quality Enhancement Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms (bdqenh:)**](docs/list/bdqenh/index.md)
- [**Fitness For Use Framework Ontology List of Terms (bdqffdq:)**](docs/list/bdqffdq/index.md)
