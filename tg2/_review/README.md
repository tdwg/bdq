# üì£ Welcome to the Public Review of the Biodiversity Data Quality (BDQ) Standard

Thank you for participating in the review of the proposed **Biodiversity Data Quality (BDQ) Core** standard.  
This folder includes documents that are intended to form part of the standard, as well as supporting resources to use, develop and maintain it.

## üß≠ How to Approach the Review

The BDQ Core standard has two major, interconnected parts:

- **BDQ Core Tests and Assertions:**  
  Practical Tests and associated guidance for assessing biodiversity data quality.
- **Fitness for Use Framework:**  
  The theoretical foundation that defines key concepts such as "Fitness for Use," "Criteria," and "Dimensions" of data quality.

## üöÄ Choose Your Review Path

### A. Introduction
First, read the [**Biodiversity Data Quality Core (BDQ) Introduction**](docs/intro/index.md). Then, you can approach the remainder of the review either from the practical perspective (the Tests) or the theoretical one (the Framework).

### B. Documents emphasizing **BDQ in Practice (the Tests)**:
- [**BDQ Core Quick Reference Guide**](docs/terms/bdqcore/index.md)
- [**BDQ Core User's Guide**](docs/guide/users/index.md)
- [**BDQ Core Tests and Assertions**](docs/bdqcore/index.md)
- [**BDQ Core Implementer's Guide**](docs/guide/implementers/index.md)
- [**BDQ Core: Identifying Synthetic and Modified Data**](docs/synthetic/index.md)

### C. Documents emphasizing **BDQ in Theory (the Framework)**:
- [**Fitness for Use Framework Ontology Guide**](docs/guide/bdqffdq/index.md)
- [**Fitness for Use Framework Ontology**](docs/bdqffdq/index.md)
- [**Fitness for Use Framework Vocabulary Extension**](docs/extension/bdqffdq/index.md)

### D. Vocabularies
The Tests and the Framework are linked with each other via **foundational vocabularies** and **controlled vocabularies of values**. The terms in these vocabularies are formally defined in the **List of terms** documents. We recommend reviewing these vocabularies carefully as well:
- [**BDQ Core Tests and Assertions List of Terms (bdqcore:)**](docs/list/bdqcore/index.md)
- [**BDQ Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms (bdq:)**](docs/list/bdq/index.md)
- [**Data Quality Criterion Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms (bdqcrit:)**](docs/list/bdqcrit/index.md)
- [**Data Quality Dimension Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms (bdqdim:)**](docs/list/bdqdim/index.md)
- [**Data Quality Enhancement Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms (bdqenh:)**](docs/list/bdqenh/index.md)
- [**Fitness For Use Framework Ontology List of Terms (bdqffdq:)**](docs/list/bdqffdq/index.md)
