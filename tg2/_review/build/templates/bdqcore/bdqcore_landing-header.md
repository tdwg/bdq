## 1 Introduction

This document provides explanatory information and normative guidance for the BDQ Core tests. The document includes terms in several namespaces that contain the recommended terms: `bdq:`, `bdqffdq:`, `bdqdim:`, `bdqenh:`, and `bdqcrit:` as well as the focus of this document the `bdqcore:` terms. For details and rationale, see Chapman AD, Belbin L, Zermoglio PF, Wieczorek J, Morris PJ, Nicholls M, Rees ER, Veiga AK, Thompson A, Saraiva AM, James SA, Gendreau C, Benson A, Schigel D (2020).

### Text to move or rewrite

<!--- Material here probably goes into the implementers or users guide --->

Tests may require reference to external data such as standard vocabularies of terms or names. While applying to a single record, the test results may be accumulated across multiple records (bdqffdq:MultiRecord), for example reporting that 75% of the records do not have a valid value for dwc:basisOfRecord. Only a subset of the values of all [Darwin Core Terms](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/) (Darwin Core Maintenance Group 2021) are referenced in the core tests. Each test focuses on a single aspect of data quality, usually a single dimension of a single Darwin Core term or small set of related input Darwin Core terms; the Information Elements which form the input data to the tests.

(Make sure to establish that the standard does not specify the "format" of the responses (JSON within an Annotation, etc.), but it does specify the required content regardless of serialization format.)

Tests are paired in that all AMENDMENTs require a corresponding VALIDATION that assesses some aspect of data quality. An AMENDMENT may be able to improve the quality of data with respect to that VALIDATION. 

Each test is designed to stand in isolation. This is by design to both support the mixing and matching of these and other tests to meet particular data quality needs, and so as not impose any particular model of test execution on implementation frameworks. Implementations of test execution frameworks may execute tests in on data records in parallel, on data records in sequence, as queries on data sets, on unique values. 

<!--- Ming: Use of MultiRecord measures to measure improvement in QA and QC, repeated in 5.2.3 --->
The framework expects that Quality Assurance is provided for through specification of a set of Measures defined to operate on a MultiRecord, and which specify a Response.result of COMPLETE or NOT_COMPLETE.  A MultiRecord Measure may specify that it is COMPLETE if all instances of a SingleRecord Validation are COMPLIANT.  

For Quality Control, MultiRecord Measures may be defined to return a count of Response.result of COMPLIANT for validations, and thus can provide a measure of how fit a data set is for some purpose, and what sort of work would be required to make it fit for that purpose.   

For a simplied list of current terms, see the BDQ Core Quick Reference Guide {http://..........}.

(Make sure this is addressed in this document) We acknowledge the centrality of the work of the TDWG Annotations Interest Group (https://github.com/tdwg/annotations) as to how the test results are reported against records. Test results structured with these three components can be readily wrapped in the body annotation document that follows the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (Sanderson et al. 2017), along with metadata from the Framework to describe which test is being reported upon, and metadata within the target of the annotation to describe which data resource is being annotated, and the state it was in at the time of annotation.

<!--- end of information that probably goes in the users or implementers guides --->

### 1.3 Characteristics of the tests (non-normative)

Each test is defined as a SingleRecord test. No CORE tests have been defined to use data in other records within a data set to evaluate the quality of data in a SingleRecord. The framework allows for MultiRecord tests able to identify outliers within a data set, or other tests that look across a MultiRecord to evaluate data quality, but we have not specified any such tests here.

The scope of each test is also largely provided by the bdqffdq:Specification. The [Darwin Core Terms](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/) (Darwin Core Maintenance Group 2021) used in the Specification are included in the "Information Elements". The "Specification" also includes references to external (to the Darwin Core standard: Wieczorek et al. 2012) authorities that are required to implement the test, for example, references to an ISO standard. Such authoritative references are listed under "Source Authority" with a link to the authority and optionally, a link to a specific online resource required for the implementation of the test.


### 1.3 Types of tests (non-normative)

The concept of 'tests' in the context of this standard include four distinct types: Validation (bdqffdq:Validation); Issue (bdqffdq:Issue); Amendment (bdqffdq:Amendment) and Measure (bdqffdq:Measure).

Each bdqcore: test is an instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed composed with an instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:Method composed with an instance of bdqffdq:Specification.  When run by an implementation, each bdqcore: test can produce a data quality report consisting of bdqffdq:Assertions.

#### 1.3.1 Validation (normative)

Each Validation Test is composed of an instance of bdqffdq:Validation (which expresses a data quality need in the abstract) with an instance of bdqffdq:ValidationMethod which links it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification (which gives details of how that data quality need is to be concretely assessed).

Validation Tests in BDQ Core evaluate values in one or more [Darwin Core Terms](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/) (Darwin Core Maintenance Group 2021) for fitness for a particular data quality need. In some cases, Validation Tests check for the presence or the lack of a value. Validation Tests are phrased as positive statements consistent with the Fitness For Use Framework (Veiga et al. 2017). For example, VALIDATION_TAXONRANK_NOTEMPTY will return a Response.status="RUN_HAS_RESULT" and Response.result="COMPLIANT" if a record under test contains a value in dwc:taxonRank, rather being phrased in the negative (i.e. VALIDATION_TAXONRANK_EMPTY) and flagging a potential problem.  Data are found to be fit for some use if all Validations comprising that Use have a Response.result="COMPLIANT". 

The formal response of Validation Tests (an instance of a bdqffdq:ValidationAssertion) MUST . 

1. A Response.status of "EXTERNAL_PRREQUISITES_NOT_MET" when an external resource (e.g. a source authority, bdq:sourceAuthority) is unavailable, and running the same test on the same data at a different time may result in a different result.
2. A Response.status of "INTERNAL_PREREQUISITES_NOT_MET" when the values of one or more of the Information Elements are such that the test cannot be meaningfully run.
3. A Response.status of "RUN_HAS_RESULT" when the prerequisites for running the test have been met, and in this situation:
  - A Response.result of either "COMPLIANT" if the values of the Information Elements meet the criteria, or "NOT_COMPLIANT" when they do not.

#### 1.3.2 Issue

Each Issue Test is composed of an instance of bdqffdq:Issue (which expresses a data quality need in the abstract) with an instance of bdqffdq:IssueMethod which links it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification (which gives details of how that data quality need is to be concretely assessed).

Issue Tests are a form of warning flag where the test is drawing attention to potential problem with the value of an Information Element for at least one use of the data.

We have used Issue Tests for a small number of cases where we wished to flag a value that might indicate a record is not fit for some purpose, but the evaluation of this case would take human review. For example, ISSUE_ANNOTATION_NOTEMPTY is informing the tester than there is at least one annotation associated with record and this should be evaluated before using the record. Similarly for the other two ISSUE-type tests: ISSUE_DATAGENERALIZATIONS_NOTEMPTY where some form of transformation has occurred, and ISSUE_ESTABLISHMENTMEANS_NOTEMPTY where the value needs to be assessed for utility.

The formal response (an instance of a bdqffdq:IssueAssertion) of Issue Tests MUST take one of three forms. 

1. A Response.status of "EXTERNAL_PRREQUISITES_NOT_MET" when an external resource (e.g. a source authority, bdq:sourceAuthority) is unavailable, and running the same test on the same data at a different time may result in a different result.  In this case, the Response.result MUST be empty.  
2. A Response.status of "INTERNAL_PREREQUISITES_NOT_MET" when the values of one or more of the Information Elements are such that the test cannot be meaningfully run.  In this case, the Response.result MUST be empty.
3. A Response.status of "RUN_HAS_RESULT" when the prerequisites for running the test have been met, and in this case:
  - A Response.result="POTENTIAL_ISSUE", a Response.result="NOT_ISSUE", or a Response.result="IS_ISSUE".

In each case, a Response.comment MUST be present with text explaining to consumers of the data quality report why the the test produced this response in this case.

None of the currently defined BDQ Core Issue tests return a Response.result of IS_ISSUE

#### 1.3.3 Amendment

Each Amendment Test is composed of an instance of bdqffdq:Amendment (which expresses how to improve data to fit a data quality need in the abstract) with an instance of bdqffdq:AmendmentMethod which links it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification (which gives details of how proposals could be made to improve data for that need).

An Amendment Test may propose a change to one or more Darwin Core Term values, or propose to fill in missing values.  The Assertion produced by an Amendment is intended to improve one or more components of the quality of the record.  The Response.result from an Amendment MUST always be treated as a proposal for a change, and MUST NOT be blindly applied to a database or record when a data quality report is used for QualityControl of an existing database or record.  Consumers of Data Quality Reports under Quality Assurance uses MAY choose to accept all proposed amendments as part of a pipeline in preparing data for an analysis.  Amendments, under the framework, may also propose changes to procedures rather than to data values, we have not framed any in this form in these tests.

#### 1.3.4 Measure 

Each Measure Test is composed of an instance of bdqffdq:Measure (which expresses how measure fittnes of data for a data quality need in the abstract) with an instance of bdqffdq:MeasurementMethod which links it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification (which gives details of how that data quality is to be measured).

The only Measure defined in BDQ Core that directly examines data is MEASURE_EVENTDATE_DURATIONINSECONDS.  It returns a Response.result measuring the amount of time represented by the value in dwc:eventDate, and can be used in QualityAssurance under specific research data quality needs to identify Occurrences where the date observed or collected is known well enough for particular analytical needs (e.g. to at least one day for phenology studies, to at least one year for other purposes) that generally summarises the results of running the VALIDATIONs and AMENDMENTs and in one case provides an indication of the length of the period of the value of dwc:eventDate.

Of these, MEASURE_EVENTDATE_DURATIONINSECONDS returns a Response.result measuring the amount of time represented by the value in dwc:eventDate and is the only numeric response Test. This Test is intended to provide an estimator for the duration of an event date that can be used as a criterion for Quality Assurance for some use cases. For example, a phenology use may need temporal resolution of records to within about a day, while a use involving long term patterns of spatial change may be satisfied by temporal resolution of a year or better.  Rather than providing specific measures for each possible duration, we chose to provide just this one generic measure that could be used as a filter criterion for any Use Case.  

Most SingleRecord Measure Tests defined in BDQ Core count the number of Validation or Amendment Tests with a specified Response.Result in a bdqffdq:SingleRecord. Measure Tests return a Response.result as either a numeric value or "COMPLETE" or "NOT_COMPLETE".  Measure Tests can also be accumulated across multiple records (bdqffdq:MultiRecord).

Data are found to be fit for some use if all Validation Tests comprising that Use Case have a Response.result="COMPLIANT", and all non-numeric Measure Tests comprising that Use Case have a Response.result="COMPLETE". The majority of BDQ Core Tests are Validations phrased in the positive sense to identify biodiversity data that are fit for the Use Case, as identified in the user scenario analyses performed by BDQ Task Group 3 (https://github.com/tdwg/bdq/tree/master/tg3).   

bdqffdq:SingleRecord MEASUREs within BDQ Core are MEASURE_VALIDATIONTESTS_COMPLIANT, MEASURE_VALIDATIONTESTS_NOTCOMPLIANT, MEASURE_VALIDATIONTESTS_PREREQUISITESNOTMET, MEASURE_AMENDMENTS_PROPOSED and MEASURE_EVENTDATE_DURATIONINSECONDS. 

For each bdqffdq:SingleRecord Validation Test, there is a bdqffdq:MultiRecord Measure Test that returns a Response.result="COMPLETE" when all records in the bdqffdq:MultiRecord have a Response.result="COMPLIANT", and a Response.result="NOT_COMPLETE" when they are not. Under Quality Assurance, these Measure Tests are the key criterion for identifying data which have quality for a Use Case. Under Quality Assurance, a bdqffdq:MultiRecord is filtered to remove records that do not fit the bdqffdq:MultiRecord Measure Tests for completeness, such that a filtered bdqffdq:MultiRecord has Response.result="COMPLETE" for all bdqffdq:MultiRecord Measure Tests.

### 1.7 Example RDF (non-normative) 

A more complete description of the tests can be found in the RDF representation of this vocabulary.  Following the bdqffdq: Framework, a test is composed of an instance of a subclass of a bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed (e.g. bdqffdq:Validation), an instance of a bdqffdq:ActedUpon information element, optionally an instance of a bdqffdq:Consulted information element, an instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:Method (e.g. bdqffdq:ValidationMethod), and an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification.  Most of the information associated with a bdqffdq:term is expressed in other vocabularies, in particular bdqffdq:.   This structure and dependence on other vocabularies can be seen in the example below of https://rs.tdwg.org/bdqcore/terms/0493bcfb-652e-4d17-815b-b0cce0742fbe VALIDATION_COUNTRYCODE_STANDARD

### 2.1 Structure of Response (normative)

Responses from each of the tests MUST be structured data, and MUST NOT be simple pass fail flags,  The Response from a test is an assertion which can form part of a data quality report or be wrapped in an annotation, and MUST include the following three components: 

1. Value is the returned result for the test, i.e. numeric for measures, a controlled vocabulary (consisting of exactly COMPLIANT or NOT_COMPLIANT) for validations or Issues (NOT_ISSUE, POTENTIAL_ISSUE, ISSUE), either a numeric value or a controlled vocabulary (consisting of exactly COMPLETE or NOT_COMPLETE for Measures, and a data structure (e.g., a list of key value pairs) for proposed changes for Amendments. 
2. Status provides a controlled vocabulary, metadata concerning the success, failure, or problems with the test. The Status also serves as a link to information about warning type values and where in the future, probabilistic assertions about the likeliness of the value could be made. 
3. Remark supplies human-readable text describing reasons for the test result output.

### 2.2 Resource Types (normative)

Each test (each instance of a bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed) MUST have exactly one bdqffdq:hasResourceType object property that relates the test to a ResouceType of bdqffdq:SingleRecord or bdqffdq:MultiRecord.  

Tests operate on data, the data may be understood as representing a single record or multiple records.  In the bdqcore: tests the single record (bdqffdq:SingleRecord) tests MAY be applied to a single of Flat Darwin Core Record, or to a single instance of a Darwin Core Observation, Taxon, Event, or other class, and MAY extend across one to many relations from that class instance to instances of classes of other types in a structured representation of Darwin Core data (Wieczorek et al 2012).  For example,    A bdqcore: SingleRecord test SHOULD NOT take multiple rows of Flat Darwin core as input.  A bdqcore: SingleRecord test SHOULD NOT 

The bdqcore test ISSUE_ANNOTATION_NOTEMPTY similarly operates on a single Flat Darwin Core record, or a single core Darwin Core class instance, and asks whether annotations exist related to that class, here this standard encourages the implementation of a standard for annotating occurrence records beyond the [Darwin Core Terms](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/) (Darwin Core Maintenance Group 2021).

Multi record (bdqffdq:MultiRecord) tests operate on a dataset as a whole, the MultiRecord tests in bdqcore: sum up results across all records for each single record test.

### 2.3 Parameterising the tests (normative)

Where a test is parameterized, a parameter (e.g. bdq:sourceAuthority) is specified in the text of the hasExpectedResponse data type property of the instance of the bdqffdq:Specification for the test.  Such a bdqffdq:Specification MUST also have a bdqffdq:hasArgument object property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Argument, which MUST have a bdqffdq:hasArgumentValue data type property carrying the default value for the parameter, and this bdqffdq:Argument MUST have a bdqffdq:hasParameter object property linking it to a bdqffdq:Parameter.  The bdqffdq:Parameter SHOULD be a class instance in the bdq: namespace (e.g. bdq:sourceAuthority).  The instance of the bdqffdq:Specification SHOULD have a bdqffdq:hasAuthoritiesDefaults data type property containing

These elements MUST be understood in concert.

Values of bdqffdq:hasAuthoritiesDefaults SHOULD be a text string listing parameters in the form of a semicolon delimited list of one or more of the following: 
     
- parameter default = "default value" 
- parameter default = "default value" {[resource]}
- parameter default = "default value" {[resource]} {API endpoint [resource]}

Examples:

     bdq:earliestValidDate default ="1582-11-15"

     bdq:sourceAuthority default = "GBIF Backbone Taxonomy" {[https://doi.org/10.15468/39omei]} {API endpoint [https://api.gbif.org/v1/species?datasetKey=d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c&amp;name=]}

When we identified that, within Core data quality needs, different portions of the community have different authorities that they are required to adopt for particular terms, we define Parameters for tests, where the Parameter values allow a particular test to behave differently when given different parameter values. Parameterized tests are those for which we saw the high likelihood of different data quality needs within the community of CORE users and CORE needs. This allows us to define general tests that provide support for non functional requirements that vary within the community. 

For example, for spatial biodiversity data to have quality for use within some countries, there exist country specific requirement for which geodetic datum is to be used.  A test for fitness for use of biodiversity data for core needs that only allowed the use of EPSG:4326 as the sole COMPLIANT value for dwc:geodeticDatum would not meet the non functional requirements for use in some countries, and thus would not meet the Core purposes for this test suite. Thus, in cases where portions of the community do have clear distinct needs for quality within Core, we provided for the parameterization of tests. Similarly, parameters are specified for depth and elevation information based on global maximum values, while users who’s data falls entirely within some smaller geographic region may be able to impose tighter constraints on depth and elevation for their data to have quality, for example for quality control to identify records needing evaluation where the specified elevation is larger than any elevation within the region.

Where there are options available for a resource that supports the test, the test will be designated as "Parameterized" and a default provided, along with a link to an authority if relevant. For example, the "GBIF taxonomic backbone" is suggested as a default for most of the tests related to taxonomic names, but the standard recognizes that other Source Authorities may be required in other circumstances, for example, The World Register of Marine Organisms or a national taxonomic authority.  When a test has a single source authority paramter, bdq:sourceAuthority is used for that parameter, but if a test takes more than one source authority parameter, these are given distinct names, for example, bdq:taxonIsMarine and bdq:geospatialLand are two source authority parameters for the test VALIDATION_COORDINATES_TERRESTRIALMARINE.
