## 5 Fitness For Use Framework Summary of Mathematical Formalization (normative) 
<!--- NOTE: The source for the mathematical forumlation of the framework is in the bdqffdq_landing-footer.md document --->

This is a Summary of pp.89-108 in: Veiga, A.K. 2016. A conceptual framework on biodiversity data quality. Tese (Doutorado) [Doctoral Thesis] Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo.  Departamento de Engenharia de Computação e Sistemas Digitais.156p. 

The following changes have been made to the original formulation: 

- dcmitype:Dataset replaced with MultiRecord.  
- Improvement Method changed to Enhancement Method.
- Improvement Policy changed to Enhancement Policy.
- Data Quality Improvement changed to Data QualityAmendment.
- Issue, IssuePolicy, IssueMethod, and IssueAssertion added as converse of Validation.
- Dimension in Context renamed Measure.
- Criterion in Context renamed Validation.
- Enhancement in Context renamed Amendment.

The bdqffdq ontology is framed with limited constraints and no rdfs:range axioms.  Under open world principles, it could be use in ways other than the constraints framed by this mathematical formulation, but this formulation SHOULD be treated as a guide for how to phrase assertions using bdqffdq: terms, and how a set of assertions made with those terms SHOULD be queried.  

## Fundamental Concepts
* U = Use Case
* D = Dimension (e.g. Completeness)  
* IE = Information Element (e.g. coordinates)
* M = Mechanism 
* C = Criterion (e.g. “in controlled vocabulary”)
* E = Enhancement (description of a means by which data could be improved e.g. recommend replacement value from a controlled vocabulary).
* S = Specification (specification of how a criterion is to be evaluated e.g. “Iterate records and calculate the proportion of records with scientific name different from null”)

## Properties
* US = Usages 
* ID = Identifier for a resource
* RT = Resource Type {SingleRecord, MultiRecord}
* sr = instance of Single Records 
* ds = instance of Dataset.
* V = Data Resource Value
* R = Assertion (result from a mechanism, of Validation, Measurement, Improvement on Resource)

## Notation
* X: Domain (Upper case symbols) 
* x: instance (lower case symbols)
* { } set
* < > tuple	
* ⋃ union
* ∁ complement
* ⋀ and (logical conjunction)
* ∈ is a member of

TODO: Update Domain/instance letters to reflect class name changes.

## Derived Concepts
### General
#### Measure
    ME = { me | me =< ie, d, rt >, ie ∈ IE, d ∈ D ⋀ rt ∈ RT }

    me1 = < ie1, d1, rt1 >

* “coordinate precision of single records”

#### Validation
     VA = { va | va = < ie, c, rt >, ie ∈ IE, c ∈ C ⋀ rt ∈ RT }   

     va1 = < ie1, c1, rt1 >

* “The value of Basis of Records of single records must be in the controlled vocabulary”

#### Amendment

    AM = { am | am = < ie, e, rt >, ie ∈ IE, e ∈ E ⋀ rt ∈ RT }

    am1 = { < ie1, e1, rt1 >}

*“Recommend valid value for taxon name in single record”

#### Issue

    IS = { is | is = < ie, c, rt >, ie ∈ IE, c ∈ ∁C ⋀ rt ∈ RT }

    is1 = { < ie1, c1, rt1 >}

* “Potential issue if geographic coordinate is at 0,0”

Note: Issue concepts would parallel Validation concepts, but are not shown further here.

### Data Quality Needs
#### Measurement Policy

    MP(u) = {me | me ⊂ ME ⋀ u ∈ U }

    mp(u1) = {me1, me2, me3, me4}
    mp(u1) = {< ie1, d1, rt2 >, < ie1, d1, rt1 >, < ie2, d1, rt1 >, < ie2, d2, rt2 >}

#### Validation Policy

    VP (u) = {va | va ⊂ VA ⋀ u ∈ U }

    vp(u1) = {va1, va2}
    vp(u1) = {< ie1, c1, rt1>, < ie2, c2, rt2> }

#### Enhancement Policy

     EP(u) = {am | am ⊂ AM ⋀ u ∈ U }

     ep(u1) = {am1, am2}

#### Data Quality Profile

      DQP (u) = {dqp | dqp = mp(u) ⋃ vp(u) ⋃ ep(u), mp ∈ MP , vp ∈ VP , ep ∈ EP ⋀ u ∈ U }

      dqp(u1) = {mp(u1), vp(u1), ep(u1)}

#### Use Case Coverage 
   
     UC(u) = { us | u ∈ U ⋀ us ⊂ US}

     uc(u1) = {us1, us2}

* “A Use Case for Niche Modeling covers MAXENT and GARP modeling”

#### Valuable Information Elements

     VIE(u) = {ie | ie ⊂ I E ⋀ u ∈ U }

* For a Use Case, what information elements are valuable.

#### Acceptable Data Quality Measure 

     MEaq(me) = {va | me ∈ C D ⋀ va ⊂ C C}

     meaq(me1) = {va1, va2}

* For the dimension in context coordinate completeness in a dataset, acceptable quality is met by all records having coordinates complete.

Note: This is a representation of the MultiRecord Measures that return COMPLETE/NOT_COMPLETE

#### Improvement Target

    IT(am) = {me ⋃ va | me ∈ ME, va ∈ VA ⋀ am ∈ AM}

    it(am1) = {me1, va2}

* Recommending coordinates based on textual locality improves the coordinate completeness of single records and may result in compliance with the criterion data set must have all records with coordinates.

### Data Quality Solutions

#### Measurement Method
    MM(me) = {s | s ⊂ S ⋀ me ∈ ME}

#### Validation Method
    VM(va) = {s | s ⊂ S ⋀ va ∈ VA}

#### Enhancement Method
    EM(am) = {s | s ⊂ S ⋀ am ∈ AM}

#### Implementation 
     I (s) = {m | m ⊂ M ⋀ s ∈ S}

     i(s1) = {m1, m2}

#### Mechanism Coverage
    MC(m) = {s | s ⊂ S ⋀ m ∈ M }

    mc(m1) = {s1, s2}

### Data Quality Reports

#### Data Resource
    DR = { dr | dr = < id, rt, v >, id ∈ I D, rt ∈ RT , (rt = sr ⋁ rt = ds) ⋀ v ∈ V }

    dr1 =< id1, rt1, v1 >

* “dr1 is a Data Resource which represents the Dataset "3cc6171e-8c52-4f65-ad7a-32c74e395f29" which contains 251,744 records” 

#### MeasurementAssertion 
     DQM(dr) = {dqm | dqm =< me, s, m, r >, me ∈ ME, s ∈ S, m ∈ M , r ∈ R ⋀ dr ∈ DR}
     
     dqm(dr1) = {< me1, s1, m1, r1 >}

* Coordinate numerical precision of the dataset 3cc6171e-8c52-4f65-ad7a-32c74e395f29 is 6.16 and this value was assigned by the software DwC-A Validator 2.0 which calculated the value by the average of significant digits of each record of the dataset.

#### ValidationAssertion 

     DQV(dr) = {dqv | dqv = < va, s, m, r >, va ∈ VA, s ∈ S, m ∈ M , r ∈ R ⋀ dr ∈ DR}

     dqv(dr1) = {< va1, s1, m1, r1 >}

* A DQ Validation asserts that the Contextualized Criterion “Geodetic Datum must be supplied” is COMPLIANT for a specific species occurrence and this validation was performed by the software Darwin Test by checking if the field Geodetic Datum of the record was not empty.

#### AmendmentAssertion
     DQA(dr) = {dqa | dqa = < am, s, m, r >, am ∈ AM, s ∈ S, m ∈ M , r ∈ R ⋀ dr ∈ DR}

     dqa(dr1) = {< am1, s1, m1, r1 >}

* An amendment is proposed to replace the current value of the scientific name by the value “Apis” because Apis is the most similar valid name based on the Levenshtein distance in the Catalog of Life database using the software DwC-A Validator 2.0.

#### Data Quality Assessment
     A(dr) = {dqm(dr) ⋃ dqv(dr) ⋃ dqa(dr) | dqm ∈ DQM, dqv ∈ DQV , dqa ∈ DQA ⋀ dr ∈ DR}

     a(dr1) = {dqm1, dqm2, dqm3, dqv1, dqa1}

#### Quality Control
     QC(dr) = {dqv(dr) ⋃ dqa(dr) | dqv ∈ DQV , dqa ∈ DQI ⋀ dr ∈ DR}

     qc(dr1) = {dqv1, dqa1}

#### Quality Assurance
     QA(dr) = {dqv(dr) | dqv ∈ DQV ⋀ dr ∈ DR}

     qa(dr1) = {dqv1, dqv2}
