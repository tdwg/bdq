## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to present the formal ontology of the Biodiversity Data Quality Fitness for Use Framework, referred to by the namespace `bdqffdq:`. This ontology defines the terms, classes, and relationships used to represent data quality concepts in a structured and interoperable manner. It forms the conceptual and semantic foundation for the BDQ Core standard.

This document gathers normative statements for the ontology, explains how to use it meaningfully within biodiversity data quality workflows, and reflects the open world assumptions of RDF/OWL modeling. It provides a reference for tools and implementations that rely on this ontology for describing quality-related elements such as Use Cases, Specifications, Criteria, Amendments, and Test responses.

### 1.2 Audience

This document is intended for technical users who need to interact directly with the BDQ Core ontology. It will be especially useful for:

- Ontology engineers and developers working on semantic web applications or data validation systems
- Standards developers seeking to align other vocabularies with BDQ Core
- Implementers generating or consuming RDF data that describes BDQ Core Tests or their results
- Researchers modeling Use Cases for biodiversity data quality assessments.

Readers should be familiar with ontology concepts, RDF/OWL syntax, and open world reasoning.

### 1.3 Associated Documents

The use of classes and properties in [bdqcore:](../../dist/bdqcore.ttl). See also the guidance provided in [Use of Properties (normative)
](#21-use-of-properties-normative).

## 2 Use of Terms (normative) 

When not represented as objects, controlled value strings MUST be used as values of bdqffdq:ResponseStatus, and bdqffdq:ResponseResult.

### 2.1 Use of Properties (normative) 

This guidance describes the use of the Framework Ontology, that is the bdqffdq: vocabulary terms, in an RDF context. This guidance MAY be used to develop models of the bdqffdq data quality Framework in more constrained forms, including UML object models, information models, classes in a programming language, or database schemas. 

This section describes normative expectations for the use of object and datatype properties to related instances of bdqffdq: classes in their intended ways given the open world limited use of domains, ranges, and other axioms in the bdqffdq Framework ontology. This guidance builds on the normative definitions of bdqffdq: object properties and datatype properties to describe how bdqffdq: terms can be composed in a useful and consistent way.

Section [2.2.6](#216-identifying-the-test-that-produced-an-assertion) highlights the importance of using the object properties with the correct cardinality to preserve the relationship between an Assertion produced by a Test and the particular Test that produced it.

#### 2.1.1 Properties Relating to Data Quality Needs (normative)

Each description of a data quality Test SHOULD include the following properties and related instances.

The bdqffdq:hasUseCase object property SHOULD have an individual with a type that is a subclass of bdqffdq:Policy as its subject.

Each instance of a subclass of a bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed SHOULD have an rdfs:label in all upper case, with underscores separating components. Tests that have a bdqffdq:hasResourceType of bdqffdq:SingleRecord SHOULD follow the convention of the subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed in all upper case as the first word, and a representation of the bdqffdq:AbstractInformationElement as a single word in all upper case as the second word, in the form TESTTYPE_INFORMATIONELEMENT_CRITERIA or TESTTYPE_INFORMATIONELEMENT_ACTION_INFORMATIONELEMENT. Tests that have a bdqffdq:hasResourceType of bdqffdq:MultiRecord SHOULD have "MULTIRECORD_" as the first element in their rdfs:label, and MAY follow the pattern MULTIRECORD_TESTTYPE_COUNT_RESULT_INFORMATIONELEMENT_CRITERIA, or MULTIRECORD_TESTTYPE_QA_INFORMANTIONELEMENT_CRITERIA.

A subproperty of the bdqffdq:hasInformationElement object property SHOULD have an individual that is a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed as its subject.

Each instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed SHOULD have exactly one bdqffdq:hasActedUponInformationElement property linking it to a bdqffdq:ActedUpon. 

Each instance of bdqffdq:ActedUpon SHOULD have one to many bdqffdq:composedOf object properties linking it to specific Information Elements.

Each instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed MAY have exactly one bdqffdq:hasConsultedInformationElement property linking it to a bdqffdq:Consulted.

Each instance of bdqffdq:Consulted SHOULD have one to many bdqffdq:composedOf object properties linking it to specific Information Elements.

Each instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed MAY have a bdqffdq:hasInformationElement property linking it to a bdqffdq:AbstractInformationElement.

Each instance of bdqffdq:AbstractInformationElement SHOULD have rdfs:label and rdfs:comment properties describing the scope of the Information Element with the rdfs:label corresponding to the INFORMATIONELEMENT portion of the rdfs:label for an instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed following the convention described above in this section.

The bdqffdq:hasSpecification object property SHOULD have an instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityMethod as its subject.

An axiom places an owl:restriction on the object of the bdqffdq:hasSpecification object property as a bdqffdq:Specification.

An instance of bdqffdq:Specification SHOULD be the object of exactly one bdqffdq:hasSpecification property linking it to an instance of a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityMethod, which SHOULD be the subject of exactly one subproperty of a bdqffdq:forDataQualityNeed property linking it to a subclass of bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed.

The bdqffdq:hasArgument object property SHOULD have a bdqffdq:Specification as its subject.

An axiom types the object of the bdqffdq:hasArgument object as a bdqffdq:Argument.

An instance of bdqffdq:Argument SHOULD have exactly one bdqffdq:hasArgumentValue data property holding the value of the argument that replaces the bdqffdq:Parameter in the bdqffdq:hasExpectedResponse of the bdqffdq:Specification. An instance of bdqffdq:Argument SHOULD have exactly one bdqffdq:hasParameter object property that denotes the parameter within the bdqffdq:hasExpectedResponse that is to be replaced by the value of the bdqffdq:hasArgumentValue.

Each instance of a bdqffdq:Specification with a bdqffdq:hasAuthoritiesDefaults value that references at least one parameter MUST have a corresponding bdqffdq:hasArgument object property. The instances of bdqffdq:Argument related through these bdqffdq:hasArgument object properties SHOULD have appropriate bdqffdq:hasArgumentValue and bdqffdq:hasParameter triples to express the actual and formal parameters for the bdqffdq:Specification instance.

The bdqffdq:hasParameter object property SHOULD have a bdqffdq:Argument as its subject.

An axiom types the object of the bdqffdq:hasParameter object property as a bdqffdq:Parameter.

Nothing in this section is to be construed as relaxing the normative statements in the [User's Guide](../guide/users/index.md) and [Implementer's Guide](../guide/implementers/index.md) concerning the expression of data quality responses in forms other than RDF. Each data quality mechanism MUST produce results corresponding to bdqffdq:Assertions with bdqffdq:hasResponseStatus, bdqffdq:hasResponseResult, and bdqffdq:hasResponseComment as specified in those guides. 

The bdqffdq:producesAssertion object property SHOULD have an instance of bdqffdq:Implementation as its subject.

#### 2.1.6 Identifying the Test that produced an Assertion

Following the object properties from an instance of a bdqffdq:Assertion to an instance of a subclass of a bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed SHOULD identify one and only one instance of a subclass of a bdqffdq:DataQualityNeed for a single instance of a bdqffdq:Assertion. If this condition is not met, it is not possible to tell which Test with which parameter argument values produced the Assertion.

Each instance of a bdqffdq:ValidationAssertion SHOULD be the object of one and only one bdqffdq:producesAssertion property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Implementation, which in turn SHOULD be the subject of one and only one bdqffdq:usesSpecification property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification, which in turn SHOULD be the object of one and only one bdqffdq:hasSpecification property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:ValidationMethod, which in turn SHOULD be the subject for one and only one bdqffdq:forValidation property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Validation.

Each instance of a bdqffdq:IssueAssertion SHOULD be the object of one and only one bdqffdq:producesAssertion property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Implementation, which in turn SHOULD be the subject of one and only one bdqffdq:usesSpecification property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification, which in turn SHOULD be the object of one and only one bdqffdq:hasSpecification property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:IssueMethod, which in turn SHOULD be the subject for one and only one bdqffdq:forIssue property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Issue.

Each instance of a bdqffdq:MeasurementAssertion SHOULD be the object of one and only one bdqffdq:producesAssertion property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Implementation, which in turn SHOULD be the subject of one and only one bdqffdq:usesSpecification property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification, which in turn SHOULD be the object of one and only one bdqffdq:hasSpecification property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:MeasurementMethod, which in turn SHOULD be the subject for one and only one bdqffdq:forMeasure property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Measure.

Each instance of a bdqffdq:AmendmentAssertion SHOULD be the object of one and only one bdqffdq:producesAssertion property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Implementation, which in turn SHOULD be the subject of one and only one bdqffdq:usesSpecification property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Specification, which in turn SHOULD be the object of one and only one bdqffdq:hasSpecification property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:AmendmentMethod, which in turn SHOULD be the subject for one and only one bdqffdq:forAmendment property linking it to an instance of a bdqffdq:Amendment.

Given an Assertion, the following query returns which Test was run with which argument values for which parameters by which mechanism to produce it. This query SHOULD only return a single row.
