<!--- Note: This document deliberately diverges from many of the SHOULD expecations of section 3.2.3 Layout and style of the SDS for the express purpose of simplicity. Some header values have been included in the first paragraph of text, others have been omitted, a table of contents has been omitted, the introduction and abstract are combined, the introduction is not given a heading, and, in consequence, headings are not numbered. --->

This document is intended to be an easy-to-read reference for the Tests maintained as part of the TDWG standard [BDQ Core]({standard_iri}) produced by the {creator} and is maintained by the {maintainer}. This document lists the BDQ Core Tests, described by terms defined in [Terms used in the Quick Reference Guide to BDQ Core Tests](bdqcore_qrg_term_descriptions.md). Definitions, comments, and examples may include namespace abbreviations (e.g., "bdq:", “dwc:”). These are required as the meaning for the word is defined specifically in that namespace. Thus, dwc:Event means Event as defined by Darwin Core at https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#event.

This page is a descriptive document, not the full vocabulary definition document for bdqcore: terms. It combines the normative Test names and terms with non-normative comments and examples that are meant to help people to use the Tests consistently. Further details can be found in the [Biodiversity Data Quality Core Introduction](../../intro/index.md), the [Fitness For Use Framework Ontology Guide](../../guide/bdqffdq/index.md), the [BDQ Core Implementer's Guide](../../guide/implementers/index.md) and the [BDQ Core List of Vocabularies](../../vocabularies/index.md) 

If you have questions or suggestions, submit these to the [BDQ Core Issues](https://github.com/tdwg/bdq/issues) page in GitHub. See the bottom of this document for how to cite BDQ Core in general and this document in particular.
