<!--- Note: This document deliberately diverges from many of the SHOULD expecations of section 3.2.3 Layout and style of the SDS for the express purpose of simplicity.  Some header values have been included in the first paragraph of text, others have been omitted, a table of contents has been omitted, the introduction and abstract are combined, the introduction is not given a heading, and, in consequence, headings are not numbered. --->

This document is intended to be an easy-to-read reference (as of {doc_modified}) of the tests maintained as part of the TDWG standard [BDQ Core]({standard_iri}) produced by the {creator} and is maintained by the BDQ Core Maintenance Group (link). This document lists the BDQ Core tests by terms defined below. Definitions, comments, and examples may include namespace abbreviations (e.g., "bdq:", “dwc:”). These are reequired as the meaning for the word is defined specifically in that namespace. Thus, dwc:Event means Event as defined by Darwin Core at https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#event.

The definitions of the terms used for tests can be found at [Terms in bdqcore: Quick Reference Guide](bdqcore_qrg_term_descriptions.md). 

This page is not part of the standard. It combines the normative test names and terms with non-normative comments and examples that are meant to help people to use the tests confidently and consistently. Further details are in the overview of document at [BDQ Core Introduction](../../intro/index.md), in the [bdqffdq Framework Users Guide](../../guide/bdqffdq/index.md), [BDQ Core Implementers Guide](../../guide/implementers/index.md) and [BDQ Core Vocabularies](../../vocabularies/index.md)
