documentTitle: Biodiversity Data Quality Controlled Vocabulary List of Terms

# Abstract of document written by authors.
abstract: 'This document is a reference for the (Draft) BDQ Core Standard, documenting vocabulary values largely used as bdqffdq:Parameters, but including a few other terms used in test Specifications.'

# This value is generally the name of the task group that created the document.
creator: 'TDWG Biodiversity Data Quality Interest Group Task Group 2: Data Quality Tests and Assertions'

# Current (2023-08-27) practice is to publish documents as Markdown files in a TDWG GitHub repository.
# These Markdown documents are then converted to HTML by GitHub Pages. To match the TDWG theme, the 
# document maintainers will need to work with the Infrastructure team to set up the repository so 
# that it can host the ancillary website for the standard or vocabulary. 
# The exact setup of the repository will determin the values of accessUrl and browserRedirectUri.

# Media type of source document used to generate the HTML version of the document.
mediaType: text/markdown

# Value determined by the location of the raw Markdown file in the GitHub repository.
# The repository pattern used should be to create a subdirectory for the document whose name will be
# the slug for the page, then place the Markdown file named index.md in that subdirectory.
accessUrl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdwg/bdq/master/tg2/_review/docs/list/bdq/index.md

# Actual URL of the document to which the permanent IRI is redirected.
# When generated by GitHub pages, this will be related to the location of the raw Markdown file.
# The initial default value is https://tdwg.github.io/repository_name/subdirectory_name/.
# However, typically, the Infrastructure team sets up a subdomain of the tdwg.org domain for the
# ancillary website. In that case, the value will eventually be 
# https://subdomain.tdwg.org/subdirectory_name/.
browserRedirectUri: https://bdq.tdwg.org/bdq/

# Values set by the TDWG Infrastructure team at time of ratification

# Permanent IRI of the standard with which the document is associated. 
# For documents added to an existing standard, see the landing page
# for the standard on the TDWG website for the correct value.
# For new standards, this value will be set by the TDWG Infrastructure team.

# IRI value assigned as a permanent identifier for the document based on standard TDWG IRI patterns.
# This value will automatically get updated from the general_configuration.yaml file. It should not be
# set manually.
current_iri: http://rs.tdwg.org/bdq/terms/

# Date of first ratification of the document. Will match the doc_modified value for the first
# version of the document. For lists of terms, this will also match the date that the
# first version of the vocabulary was issued (date_issued).
