## 1 Introduction

This document includes terms that form the bdqffdq: vocabulary. The bdqffdq: vocabulary is used to describe the the BDQ Core Tests.

The bdqffdq: terms include classes, object properties, datatype properties, and named individuals. This document only lists the terms, it does not provide additional axioms or normative guidance needed for their use.

The bdqffdq framework is represented as an owl ontology (the Framework Ontology). The basic terms for that framework are listed in this document.
The TDWG Standards Documentation Specification requires that the human readable documentation for ontologies be presented 
as a term list with additional axioms included in a vocabulary extension. A [vocabulary extension](../../extension/bdqffdq/index.md) 
documents additional axioms.

### 1.1 Purpose
: This is the term-list document for the bdqffdq: vocabulary.

### 1.2 Audience

This document is for those needing a technical understanding of the BDQ Core Tests and the application of the Biodiversity Data Quality Fitness for Use Framework Ontology.

### 1.3 Documents about the bdqffdq: ontology

The bdqffdq: vocabulary is an ontology, documentation for it can be found in: 

- A [landing page](../../bdqffdq/index.md) with normative guidance on the use of this ontology.
- This page, the list of vocabulary terms in the ontology.
- Additional axioms that extend the vocabulary terms in the [vocabulary extension list](../../extension/bdqffdq/index.md) 
- The bdqffdq framework ontology is best technically understood as its [Owl Ontology Distribution](../../../vocabulary/bdqffdq.owl) 

An illustrated guide to the use of the bdqffdq ontology is provided in the [Guide to the bdqffdq: framework](../../guide/bdqffdq/index.md)

### 1.4 Status of the content of this document

Sections 1 and 3 are non-normative.

Section 2 is normative.

Section [1.7 Key to Vocabulary Terms](#17-Key-to-Vocabulary-Terms) identifies which values in Section 4 are normative and which are non-normative.

Any sentence or phrase beginning with "For example" or "e.g." is non-normative.

### 1.5 RFC 2119 key words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) [\[RFC 2119\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and [\[RFC 8174\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.7 Key to Vocabulary Terms

The terminology used to describe the terms in this vocabulary follows the TDWG Standards Documentation Standard (SDS). Each term definition includes the original RDF definition, and may also provide a TDWG-specific interpretation from the SDS, as well as a definition tailored to this local context.

## 2 Use of Terms (normative)

In an RDF context, a reference to a term in the `bdqffdq:` namespace MUST use the Term IRI (e.g., `http://rs.tdwg.org/bdq/bdqffdq/InformationElement`) or Term Qualified name (e.g., `bdqffdq:InformationElement`). In a non-RDF context in which resources may be used by software (e.g., a value in a spreadsheet or database table) the Controlled Value String (Local name, e.g., `InformationElement`) MAY be used. In a purely human context a Label (e.g., `Information Element`) MAY be used.
