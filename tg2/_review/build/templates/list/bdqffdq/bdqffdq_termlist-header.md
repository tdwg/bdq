## 1 Introduction

This document provides a structured list of terms that constitute the bdqffdq: vocabulary. The vocabulary is part of the Biodiversity Data Quality (BDQ) Fitness for Use Framework Ontology and is primarily used to describe the BDQ Core Tests. It includes ontology elements such as classes, object properties, datatype properties, and named individuals.

Following the TDWG Standards Documentation Specification, this document presents a human-readable term list. It does not include additional axioms or normative usage guidance, which are instead provided through supporting documentation and vocabulary extensions.

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to serve as the official term list for the bdqffdq: vocabulary. It defines the core ontology elements used to express BDQ Core Tests, without incorporating additional axioms or implementation constraints.

### 1.2 Audience

This document is intended for users who require a technical understanding of the BDQ Core Tests, including ontology developers, data quality analysts, and others implementing or interpreting the Biodiversity Data Quality Fitness for Use Framework Ontology in data systems or tools.

### 1.3 Documents about the bdqffdq: ontology

Comprehensive information about the bdqffdq: ontology, its usage, and its extensions can be found in the following resources:

- The [Fitness for Use Ontology](../../bdqffdq/index.md), which provides normative guidance on the use of the vocabulary.
- This term list document, which enumerates and describes the vocabulary terms.
- The [Fitness For Use Framework Ontology Vocabulary Extension](../../extension/bdqffdq/index.md), which defines additional axioms extending the core vocabulary.
- The [Fitness For Use Framework Ontology Guide](../../guide/bdqffdq/index.md), a visual and narrative introduction to the concepts and application of the ontology.
- The ontology itself: [[Biodiversity Data Quality Fitness for Use Framework](../../../vocabulary/bdqffdq.owl), which provides the formal RDF/OWL representation of the vocabulary.

### 1.7 Key to Vocabulary Terms

The terminology used to describe the terms in this vocabulary follows the TDWG Standards Documentation Standard (SDS). Each term definition includes the original RDF definition, and may also provide a TDWG-specific interpretation from the SDS, as well as a definition tailored to this local context.

## 2 Use of Terms (normative)

In an RDF context, a reference to a term in the `bdqffdq:` namespace MUST use the Term IRI (e.g., `http://rs.tdwg.org/bdq/bdqffdq/InformationElement`) or Term Qualified name (e.g., `bdqffdq:InformationElement`). In a non-RDF context in which resources may be used by software (e.g., a value in a spreadsheet or database table) the Controlled Value String (Local name, e.g., `InformationElement`) MAY be used. In a purely human context a Label (e.g., `Information Element`) MAY be used.
