## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide the official term list for the `bdqffdq:` vocabulary, which defines the ontology elements used in the Biodiversity Data Quality Fitness for Use Framework. This includes classes, object properties, data properties, and named individuals that collectively support the semantic description of BDQ Core Tests and related quality constructs.

This document presents a human-readable view of the vocabulary and follows the TDWG Standards Documentation Specification. It does not include additional axioms, implementation guidance, or usage recommendations â€” those are addressed in complementary documentation and the [Fitness For Use Framework Ontology Vocabulary Extension](docs/extension/bdqffdq/index.md).

### 1.2 Audience

This document is intended for technical users who need to reference the `bdqffdq:` vocabulary in detail. It is particularly useful for:

- Ontology developers integrating BDQ Core concepts into semantic systems
- Data quality analysts and system implementers interpreting or expressing BDQ Test structures using RDF/OWL
- Standards developers needing access to term-level details when aligning or extending the BDQ Core framework.

Familiarity with RDF, OWL, and the structure of the BDQ Core Tests is recommended.

### 1.3 Associated Documents

For the list and links to all associated documents see the [Biodiversity Data Quality (BDQ) Core](../../index.md) page, which lists the parts of the standard.

### 1.4 Status of the content of this document

Sections 1 and 3 are non-normative.

Section 2 is normative.

Section [1.7 Key to Vocabulary Terms](#17-Key-to-Vocabulary-Terms) identifies which values in Section 4 are normative and which are non-normative.

Any sentence or phrase beginning with "For example" or "e.g." is non-normative.

### 1.5 RFC 2119 key words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) [\[RFC 2119\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and [\[RFC 8174\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.7 Key to Vocabulary Terms

The terminology used to describe the terms in this vocabulary follows the TDWG Standards Documentation Standard (SDS). Each term definition includes the original RDF definition, and may also provide a TDWG-specific interpretation from the SDS, as well as a definition tailored to this local context.

## 2 Use of Terms (normative)

In an RDF context, a reference to a term in the `bdqffdq:` namespace MUST use the Term IRI (e.g., `http://rs.tdwg.org/bdq/bdqffdq/InformationElement`) or Term Qualified name (e.g., `bdqffdq:InformationElement`). In a non-RDF context in which resources may be used by software (e.g., a value in a spreadsheet or database table) the Controlled Value String (Local name, e.g., `InformationElement`) MAY be used. In a purely human context a Label (e.g., `Information Element`) MAY be used.
