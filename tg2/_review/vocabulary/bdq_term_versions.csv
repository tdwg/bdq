In the BDQ standard, bdq:Empty is used to evaluate bdqffdq:InformationElements within a Test specification, it therefore means empty if the dataset being evaluated does not contain the term matching the Information Element, or if the dataset contains that term but the value for that term is empty. The phrasing 'in the context of the evauation' is to allow the Test implementations to be independent of, and agnostic about the data structures presented to a framework for executing the Tests and the framework within which the Tests are run. The term bdq:Empty is defined to be more broadly usable than just with bdqtest. Note: A bdqffdq:InformationElement containing invalid characters (e.g., letters in an Information Element that would be expected to contain integers) or values (including string serializations of the NULL value) are bdq:NotEmpty and their invalidity must be separately detected. The definition of bdq:Empty is not applicable to a discussion of what value to include in a controlled vocabulary to indicate that no meaningful value is present, so no suggestion is made that bdq:Empty should be used as a data value to represent some form of 'Null', 'unknown', 'not recorded', etc. Choices there would fall into the semantics for some set of controlled vocabularies. The relevance to such a discussion is that the definition of bdq:Empty would treat an empty string as an empty value, with no semantics attached as to why the value is empty",,"Empty"
