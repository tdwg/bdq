This test specifically does not consider the content of dwc:higherGeography. If dwc:country contains a value and dwc:stateProvince does not, this test will return NOT_COMPLIANT. Use cases where knowledge to the level of country is adequate for the fitness of the data should not include this test. @tucotuco: ""Of #200 and #201, #201 is the strongest test. If it passes for a record, #200 must necessarily also pass and doesn't tell you anything. If #201 fails,#200 could still pass and that would tell you that there are multiple matches on the dwc:country/dwc:stateProvince combo: It would tell you the nature of the problem. Along with #42 (dwc:country not empty), #200 would tell you whether there was an ambiguous combination of country (not empty) and dwc:stateProvince, such as would happen with Argentina/Buenos Aires.
