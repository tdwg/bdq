<h2>Outcomes</h2>
TG2 has been working for over 10 years to evaluate, refine and develop new tests that evaluate 'data quality'/'fitness for use' of biodiversity coded using the Darwin Core Standard. TG2 has developed a framework for describing, running and evaluating a standard suite of tests, test data and comprehensive vocabularies.
