<h2>Outcomes</h2>
The group has been working for over 10 years to evaluate and refine'data quality'/'fitness for use' tests that have been run by-
<ul>
<li>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)</<li>
<li>The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)</li>
<li>iDigBio</li>
<li>Ocean Biogeographic Information Facility (OBIS)</li>
<li>Centro de Referência em Informação Ambiental (CRIA)</li>
<li>Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON)</li>
<li>Vertnet</li>
  </ul>
  
and to generate new CORE tests. In the process, we have come up with a standard suite of descriptors/specifications for each of the tests, test data and a comprehensive vocabulary as noted above.
