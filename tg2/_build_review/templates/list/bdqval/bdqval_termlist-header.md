## 1 Introduction (non-normative)

### 1.1 Purpose (non-normative)

The purpose of this document is to provide the full term list for the `bdqval:` controlled vocabulary, which supports the specification and use of BDQ Tests. The `bdqval:` vocabulary includes concepts used throughout the BDQ standard to describe Test parameters, data structures, Information Elements, source authorities, and special value cases such as Empty and NotEmpty relevant to the execution and behavior of Tests.

This term list defines the formal structure and meanings of these concepts and provides reference material for implementation and documentation purposes.

### 1.2 Audience (non-normative)

This document is intended for technical users who need a precise understanding of the vocabulary elements used in BDQ Test `Specifications` and reports. It will be particularly useful for:

- Implementers interpreting or extending BDQ Test logic
- Standards developers and data quality modelers working with BDQ vocabularies
- Analysts and system designers configuring parameterized data quality assessments
- Curators needing to understand the conceptual basis for different Test evaluations

Familiarity with RDF vocabularies and the Fitness For Use Framework is recommended for full comprehension, but the document is organized to be accessible for any reader needing detailed term definitions.

### 1.3 Data Quality Vocabulary Terms (non-normative)

The `bdqval:` vocabulary includes three groups of concepts used across the BDQ standard:

- **Test Parameters** (`bdqffdq:Parameter`) – concepts used to configure the behavior of Tests, including named parameters like `bdqval:sourceAuthority`.
- **Information Elements** – used by `Multi Record` `Measure` Tests to refer to aggregated or referenced values.
- **Empty/NotEmpty Concepts** – `bdqval:Empty` and `bdqval:NotEmpty`, which provide shared semantics for Tests dealing with missing or present values.

These terms ensure consistent representation and enable structured interpretation of Test configurations and outcomes.

### 1.6 Status of the Content of this Document (normative)

Sections may be either normative (defines what is required to comply with the standard) or non-normative (supports understanding but is not binding) and are marked as such. 

Any sentence or phrase beginning with "For example" or "e.g.", whether in a normative section or a non-normative section, is non-normative.

Section [1.9 Key to Vocabulary Terms (normative)](#19-key-to-vocabulary-terms-normative) identifies which values in Section 4 are normative and which are non-normative.

### 1.7 RFC 2119 key words (normative)

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) [\[RFC 2119\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and [\[RFC 8174\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.8 Namespace abbreviations (non-normative)

The following namespace abbreviations are used in this document:

### 1.9 Key to Vocabulary Terms (normative)

The terminology used to describe the terms in this vocabulary follows the TDWG [TDWG Standards Documentation Standard (SDS)](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/sds/) (SDS). Each term definition includes the original RDF definition, and may also provide a TDWG-specific interpretation from the SDS, as well as a definition tailored to this local context.

## 2 Use of Terms (normative)

In an RDF context, a reference to a term in the `{pref_namespace_prefix}:` namespace MUST use the Term IRI (e.g., `https://rs.tdwg.org/{pref_namespace_prefix}/terms/NotEmpty`) or Term Qualified name (e.g., `{pref_namespace_prefix}:NotEmpty`). In a non-RDF context in which resources may be used by software (e.g., a value in a spreadsheet or database table) the Controlled Value String (local name, e.g., `NotEmpty`) SHOULD be used. In a purely human context a label (e.g., `Not Empty`) MAY be used.
