Since different systems have differing requirements for what the default datum should be, it is left unspecified, but should match whatever the target datum is in AMENDMENT_COORDINATES_CONVERTED (620749b9-7d9c-4890-97d2-be3d1cde6da8). After the amendment is performed, the dwc:geodeticDatum field should be the assumed default datum as parameterized. An example implementation to determine the uncertainty added by asserting a default datum (datum shift) where a known datum is not declared can be found in [datumshiftproj.py](https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/blob/master/source/python/datumshiftproj.py) in the source code for the [Georeferencing Calculator](http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html) (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2021). Included in the source code is a [5-degree grid](https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/blob/master/datumerrordata.js) of datum shifts from an unknown datum to WGS84.","open","TG2 Amendment SPACE Test Completeness Parameterized CORE","bdq:Spatial-Temporal_Patterns, bdq:Record-Management","7fd3889a-0d1d-4054-8e68-807cfa5410f2","recommended","","Amendment"
