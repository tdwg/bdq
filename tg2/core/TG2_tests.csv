Different calendars have been used at different times in different places, and the transcription of an original date in one calendar into dwc:eventDate, where a Gregorian Calendar is assumed, may or may not have been done with the correct translation of the date, and metadata may or not be present to even identify such records.

Likewise, country polygons cannot be 100% accurate at all scales (Dooley 2005), so a spatial buffer of the country boundaries is also justified. Taking spatial buffers into account does however greatly complicate the logic and the implementation of this and related tests. In this test, a detection of multiple country codes by sampling within the buffer while possible, is not considered.","open","TG2 Amendment SPACE Test VOCABULARY Completeness ISO/DCMI STANDARD Parameterized CORE","bdq:Spatial-Temporal_Patterns, bdq:Record-Management"
